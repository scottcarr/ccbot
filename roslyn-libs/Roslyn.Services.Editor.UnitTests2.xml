 various things about it. This is used in the tests for the rename engine

 <summary>
 The list of related locations that haven't been asserted about yet. Items are
 removed from here when they are asserted on, so the set should be empty once we're
 done.

<member name="T:Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.UnitTests.Rename.RenameEngineTests">
 <summary>
 This test class contains tests which verifies that the rename engine performs correct
 refactorings that do not break user code. These tests call through the
 Renamer.RenameSymbol entrypoint, and thus do not test any behavior with interactive
 rename. The position given with the $$ mark in the tests is just the symbol that is renamed;
 there is no fancy logic applied to it.
